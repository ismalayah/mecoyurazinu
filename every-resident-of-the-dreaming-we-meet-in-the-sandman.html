Over the course of The Sandman‘s 10-part first season, we encounter many beings that dwell in the Dreaming, from Morpheus’ loyal staff to some of the Dreams and Nightmares that populate the place. Not to mention those that have gone rogue and escaped into the waking world.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>There are so many characters in the show that it’s hard to keep track, in fact, so here’s a handy guide to every resident of the Dreaming that’s introduced in The Sandman season one.</p><h2 id=h-dreaming-residents data-injectable=false>Dreaming residents</h2><h2 id=h-dream data-injectable=false>Dream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Sandman-3-1.jpg><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The most notable resident of the Dreaming is, of course, Lord Morpheus himself (Tom Sturridge). Sandman has a symbiotic relationship with his realm as the world of dreams decayed and his castle fell into disrepair when he was imprisoned on Earth for a century, only healing when he eventually returned.</p><h2 id=h-lucienne data-injectable=false>Lucienne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sandman-lucienne-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Lucienne (Vivienne Achaempong) is officially the chief librarian of the Dreaming, watching over the realm’s vast libraries which contain every book ever written and those that will be written. Unofficially, she is the de-facto ruler of the Dreaming in Dream’s stead, something he eventually comes to accept.</p><h2 id=h-cain-and-abel data-injectable=false>Cain and Abel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Sandman-Cain-Abel-2.png><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>The biblical Cain (Sanjeev Bhaskar) and Abel (Asim Chaudhry), the world’s first murderer and victim, dwell in the Dreaming, in their matching Houses of Mystery and Secrets. The temperamental Cain frequently murders his meek brother. They were the only two residents to remain in the realm after Dream’s incarceration.</p><h2 id=h-gregory-and-goldie data-injectable=false>Gregory and Goldie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Sandman-Cain-Gregory.jpg><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Cain and Abel initially lived with their loyal pet gargoyle, Gregory, until Sandman reluctantly had to uncreate him in order to refuel his power. To make it up to them, Dream stole a serpent’s egg and brought it to life as a baby gargoyle which Able named Goldie (not Irving).</p><h2 id=h-merv-pumpkinhead data-injectable=false>Merv Pumpkinhead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/merv-pumpkinhead-1.jpg><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>The janitor of Dream’s castle in the Dreaming is Mervyn “Merv” Pumpkinhead (Mark Hamill). With a thick Brooklyn accent, Merv has a laid-back, jaded demeanor. He appears to have grown close to Lucienne during Dream’s incarceration as he defers to her and not Morpheus during times of crisis.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Martin Tenbones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barbie-martin-tenbones-the-sandman-e1660047869728-1.jpg><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Martin Tenbones (Lenny Henry) is a giant canine-esque beast and the constant companion to Rose’s friend Barbie in her dreams, in which she is a princess on a bold quest in a fantastical part of the Dreaming known as The Land.</p><h2 id=h-jessamy data-injectable=false>Jessamy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jessamy-in-The-Sandman.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>Tradition dictates that the Sandman is always accompanied by a raven, a human soul who has been reborn into bird-form to serve the Dream King. Jessamy was his raven during the early 20th century, until she was killed by Alex Burgess while attempting to free her master.</p><h2 id=h-matthew data-injectable=false>Matthew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-sandman-matthew-the-raven-1.png><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>When he returned to the Dreaming, Lucienne assigned Dream a new raven — namely, Matthew (Patton Oswalt). Despite admitting to being a not-so-good person in life, Matthew quickly adjusted to his new role as Morpheus’ faithful companion and (mostly) fearlessly accompanied him on his multi-dimensional quest for his missing tools.</p><h2 id=h-rogue-dreams data-injectable=false>Rogue dreams</h2><h2 id=h-corinthian data-injectable=false>Corinthian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sandman-1.jpg><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Though nearly all of the Dreams and Nightmares returned to the Dreaming once Sandman returned, three rogues did not. At the top of the list was The Corinthian (Boyd Holbrook). A particularly cruel Nightmare, with mouths instead of eyes, he was determined to destroy his master so he could be free to live — and murder — on Earth.</p><h2 id=h-gilbert-fiddler-s-green data-injectable=false>Gilbert/Fiddler’s Green</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gilbert-sandman-1.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Though Fiddler’s Green — a sentient paradise-like dreamland — was loyal to the Sandman, his longing to live among humanity was too great to resist. In his human guise as Gilbert (Stephen Fry), Fiddler’s Green unwittingly befriended the Dream Vortex Rose before voluntarily returning to the Dreaming.</p><h2 id=h-gault data-injectable=false>Gault</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gault-Sandman-1.jpg><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Like The Corinthian, the shapeshifting Gault (Ann Ogbomo) was another Nightmare that went rogue. Unlike The Corinthian, she did so because she no longer wished to scare people. Although Dream initially intended to punish her disobedience, he ultimately granted Gault her wish and recreated her as a Dream.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSrsGaqlai2pbHNrWSonl2ptaZ5w6ucmqWZo7Ruw8RmpJ6dpGK2r3nToZxmq5Gjsa6tzWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
