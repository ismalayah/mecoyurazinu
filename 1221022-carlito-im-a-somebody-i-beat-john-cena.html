Sometimes [the older fans that now have kids] they’ll explain, ‘Oh, this is Carlito…’ And they’re like, [uninterested],” Carlito explained, “but it happens every single time, they say, ‘Yeah, he beat John Cena!’ and you just see their eyes light up. Like, ‘Oh my God. I don’t know who this guy is, but he beat John Cena, he’s got to be somebody!’”</p><p class=p2>Carlito looked back on some other memorable moments from his WWE career, including his favorite episode of “Carlito’s Cabana” and his WrestleMania 21 interaction with&nbsp;‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin and ‘Rowdy’ Roddy Piper.</p><p class=p2>“My first WrestleMania and I have to go out there with ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin and ‘Rowdy’ Roddy Piper? Two kings on the microphone, I was just hoping I could keep up with them. It was cool. I think I spit in Piper’s face but it didn’t end the way that I wanted.”</p><p>Carlito also said wrestling Ric Flair was awesome and noted that he knew Flair since he was a kid, so stepping in the ring with him was a “great honor.”</p><p class=p2>“Not only that, but Ric Flair wrestled my Dad a whole bunch of times back in the day, so I’d seen him as a kid wrestling my Dad down in Puerto Rico. So, to be able to get in the ring with Ric Flair was a nice little feather in my cap.”</p><p>Check out Carlito’s full appearance on The Bump at the top of this post; his debut match against John Cena can be seen below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFraGlqYmKwor7LoquoZZmieqJ50qiknpqfmcZutYybnJqsXZ%2B8qbqMnJynmQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
