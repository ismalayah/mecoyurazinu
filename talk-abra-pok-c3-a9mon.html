Shiny Isn't Abra special in the fact that Abra's shiny sprite is truly shiny, instead of alternately colored?--KukiTalk 19:37, 10 May 2008 (UTC) Anybody understand what he's taking about? --ニョロトノ666 19:40, 10 May 2008 (UTC) I think i do. Abra's Shiny sprite looks almost exactly the same. David Aipom Yeah, he means that Abra's shiny sprite looks like someone polished it. I'm Missingno.

Its former base experience was 73. The others are <a href=# title="Machop (Pokémon)">Machop</a>, <a href=# title="Geodude (Pokémon)">Geodude</a>, <a href=# title="Omanyte (Pokémon)">Omanyte</a>, and <a href=# title="Kabuto (Pokémon)">Kabuto</a>." still seems notable to me, much more so than other trivia deleted by Crystal Talian. This information should definately stay on the page, for anyone who is playing the first 3 gens of games. And of course the same goes for Machop and the others mentioned. <a href=# title=User:Zurqoxn>Zurqoxn</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Zurqoxn">talk</a>) 15:39, 27 March 2013 (UTC)</p>The change is mentioned via tooltip in Abra's infobox. Since it was more than one Pokémon that changed, and since the information is already on the page, I currently do not feel that it needs to be added back. However, I will ask staff how they feel about it, and happily add it back if it is notable. Thank you for pointing it out. <a href=# title="User:Crystal Talian"><span>Crystal</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Crystal Talian"><span>Talian</span></a> 21:50, 27 March 2013 (UTC) Oh right, I forgot about tooltips. Complaint withdrawn, I guess. <a href=# title=User:Zurqoxn>Zurqoxn</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Zurqoxn">talk</a>) 12:59, 1 April 2013 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=stupid_trivia>stupid trivia</span></h2><p>"Abra and its evolutions are featured in every Pokédex of a region based on Japan." applies to too many Pokemon(machop line off the top of my head but there are probably others) and is way too specific. It's like saying the exxegcute line are the only pokemon to appear in gen 1, 2 and 4(it doesn't but you get my point) <a href=# title=User:0danmaster0>0danmaster0</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:0danmaster0">talk</a>) 20:30, 27 June 2013 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Possible_Trivia>Possible Trivia</span></h2><p>I'll ask before adding it, is it worth noting the Abra line's parallel relationship to the Gastly line? Similar base stats across all three stages (Kadabra just 5 points lower, Abra and Alakazam the same), evolve by trading, have mutual type advantages on the other, the anime's Sabrina arc. <a href=# title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Drake Clawfang">talk</a>) 03:50, 6 November 2013 (UTC)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4murbeZepmrmY9dnbC3hHxqXnlporyvdQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
