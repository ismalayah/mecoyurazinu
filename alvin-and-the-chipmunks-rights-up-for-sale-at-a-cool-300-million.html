Recommended Videos Music, film, television, video games, toys, merchandising; you name it, and the chances are high that Alvin, Simon and Theodore have had their faces stamped all over it. CNBC is now reporting that Bagdasarian Productions are looking to sell off the rights to the property, but it comes armed with a very steep price tag said to be hovering around the $300 million mark."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sure, they were largely terrible and drove parents all over the world mad, but Alvin and the Chipmunks, The Squeakuel, Chipwrecked and The Road Chip combined to earn almost $1.4 billion at the box office, so there’s evidently still some value left in the IP.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>The CNBC report names ViacomCBS as an interested party, but does also mention that talks have been held with a number of potential buyers. A streaming service is almost certainly among them, because <strong>Alvin and the Chipmunks </strong>has already been proven as a viable and reliable source of content for decades, and new TV shows or films would be of huge benefit to several platforms looking to expand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWumaN6orrDZquhnV2Ytaq8zK6lpKtdp7aotNOsZK6oXZu8s3nSmqOeZZGpeqJ5wqimpWVjZX1uucilo6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
