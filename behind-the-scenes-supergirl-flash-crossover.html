The team-up event should be particularly enjoyable&nbsp;for fans of Glee, where Melissa Benoist was a series regular for a few seasons and Grant Gustin had a recurring role.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The world-hopping possibilities for the superheroes began to be hinted last year, and were all-but-solidified when The Flash and his friends journeyed into Earth-2 and a quick glimpse of the Girl of Steel could be seen in between the universes. The Flash has teamed up with another hero before – CW’s own Arrow – but it’s still undeniably cool that two networks are bridging the gap and letting some fan-favorite characters pair-up.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>It’ll be interesting to see how The Flash side of things plays into the crossover, but it’ll undoubtedly be&nbsp;a small line of dialogue to reference Barry’s journey, unlike when Barry teams up with Oliver Queen and the two get their own entire episode. The official <a href=#>Supergirl YouTube channel</a> also has a handful of new minute-long clips from the episode, for anyone who absolutely can’t&nbsp;wait until Monday to see the first glimpses at the interaction between the heroes.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>Check out the official synopsis for “World’s Finest” below, and let us know how excited you are for the <strong>Supergirl</strong> and The Flash crossover in the comments.</p><p>“Worlds Finest” – Kara gains a new ally when the lightning-fast superhero The Flash (Grant Gustin) suddenly appears from an alternate universe and helps Kara battle Siobhan, aka Silver Banshee, and Livewire in exchange for her help in finding a way to return him home, on Supergirl, Monday, March 28 (8:00-9:00 PM) on the CBS Television Network.
