As all of the parents are chatting and fast-walking, a group of teens climb a fence at a major construction site on the edge of town and do what kids do—they run through the nearly-constructed building, spray paint the walls, and then one asks for a cigarette. The adults on the other side of town are stopped in their tracks by a huge explosion. It turns out there were gas canisters stored improperly. And then, as the parents watch the rescue effort, the building collapses, killing all but one of the teens.</p><p>How does a group of people survive the unimaginable? Thorne was clearly inspired by major incidents like the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 that killed 72 people. As in that case, human beings have a need to blame someone. The main instigator and only survivor Leona (Jade Croot) happens to be the daughter of Iwan (<a href=#>Mark Lewis</a> Jones), a major proponent of the construction project and the abusive, alcoholic husband of Polly (<a href=#>Sarah Lancashire</a>). Was Leona committing vandalism to get back at her father? Is she to blame for the deaths of her friends?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5dd468bf646d6a113e46d4ed/content_Accident2.jpg><p>There are other places to point fingers. We meet Debbie Kethin (Genevieve Barr), whose husband becomes the fall guy for the placement of the gas canisters. And the second lead, after Lancashire’s Polly, is the conflicted Harriet Paulsen (<a href=#>Sidse Babett Knudsen</a>), who works for the company behind the construction. Harriet is constantly torn between wanting to do what’s right and save her job. Attorneys, media leaks, in-fighting among the relatives of the survivors—it’s a lot of action for four 45-minute episodes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZpqcpaHBbrDRmqSaZZ%2BberW0xGaYnJuZmbKvwIysn6itnJl6orzPnpilZaSkeqnBy65krK2SqLCztcGeqaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
