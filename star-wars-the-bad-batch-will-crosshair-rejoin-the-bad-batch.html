A sharp and cool sniper, Crosshair was forced to comply with Order 66 and follow Imperial orders after being captured and implanted with an inhibitor chip like the rest of the clones (or “regs,” as the rest of the team calls them)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But that would not be his ultimate end.</p><h2 id=h-will-crosshair-rejoin-the-bad-batch data-injectable=false>Will Crosshair rejoin The Bad Batch?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-bad-batch-clone-force-99.jpg><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>Crosshair was missing from the first two episodes of Bad Batch’s 16-episode sequel season. Instead, Crosshair reappeared as the main character of episode three, “The Solitary Clone.” Featuring the return of a <a href=#>beloved clone commander</a>, the episode sees Crosshair return to action after being stranded on Kamino. As strict as ever, Crosshair follows the command of a scrupulous and suspicious Vice Admiral Rampart when he is sent to a former Separatist planet to help enact Imperial rule.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>But will Crosshair be rejoining the eponymous team that gave the series its name? We can’t yet tell what side Crosshair will end up on, but episode three may have laid the groundwork for a shift in his understanding of orders, law, and following commands. Commander Cody openly questions their roles and actions as soldiers of the empire before going AWOL, but even if Crosshair can’t admit his actions as a soldier have been immoral, we can see the splinter between him and the imperials in the way Rampart treats him and other clones.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Maybe he won’t think his actions were wrong, but he’ll realize loyalty is not valued in both directions and perhaps defect like the rest of Clone Force 99. Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Echo, and their younger clone sister Omega have already shown great compassion to Crosshair, saving his life in the battle on Kamino, but will Crosshair go too far before he can be saved? His redemption arc may only just be beginning.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Star Wars: The Bad Batch is streaming on Disney Plus, with new episodes releasing every Wednesday.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCrZLCZoqh6tbTEZpmanF2XrrWvx2auoqScYrCzu9Ksn5qhomK%2FprbOoqVmrJiaeqOtw2aZmqyTnXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
