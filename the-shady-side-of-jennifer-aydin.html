While writing her memoir, "<a href=#>Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget: How to Survive in Business and Life</a>," Josephs shared the story of her experience with the other ladies. The Housewives met her with praise and even bonded about experiencing similar issues. Not one to bite her tongue, however, Jennifer Aydin challenged her. Aydin questioned how Josephs had previously retold the story as a joke, and said it sounded like Josephs willingly slept with her boss to get ahead. "I didn't understand that she felt powerless, I just thought she was a young girl living it up," Aydin said in her confessional. Aydin offered up an apology and the two seemed to make amends, though not for long.&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the season, the two clashed again when Josephs called Aydin a <a href=#>"sloppy drunk,"</a>&nbsp;and Aydin soon decided to strike back. "You told us about sloppy moments that you had. You slept with your boss," she told her. Josephs felt betrayed by her comments. "Do you see what kind of person you are?" she told Aydin. "I revealed an intimate moment and you're trying to hurt me." When the episode aired, Josephs took to Twitter and revealed how hurtful Aydin's comments were,&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeting</a>, "Victim shaming is an all time low. I shared a vulnerable moment that was very painful."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
