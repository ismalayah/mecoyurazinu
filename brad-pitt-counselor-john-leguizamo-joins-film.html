Now, thanks to the fact that some schedules have been jumbled around, the film has moved into production already, as evidenced by the fact we have the first snap of <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> on set in London.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Pitt will play Westray, a very enigmatic figure who is part of the drug trade and advises Michael Fassbender’s character on his new profession. This will be the star’s second team up with director Ridley Scott, after the filmmaker launched Pitt’s career years ago with the brilliant Thelma & Louise. In that film, he played a hustling male prostitute. Something tells me that this role will be quite different.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>It’s only a small part and for Pitt to be attracted to a role like this is not something we hear of very often now. He has done the same on Twelve Years a Slave&nbsp;though, (which will also see him star with Fassbender), taking a smaller part yet landing a producer credit too. Like his pal George Clooney, Pitt is dedicating himself now to producing and starring in really interesting movies, despite their box office potential.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>With his recent output containing the likes of <a href=#>Moneyball</a>, <a href=#>The Tree of Life</a> and <a href=#>Killing Them Softly</a>, we can expect Pitt’s quality control to be consistent for these next two projects, especially since they have some serious names behind them. To say he is taking roles which he would have perhaps vied for at the start of his career, speaks volumes about the quality of the work on <strong>The Counselor</strong> and Twelve Years a Slave.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Other news on <strong>The Counselor</strong> front is that John Leguizamo has joined the Cormac McCarthy-scripted film, filling in a supporting role of a low level drug dealer. No word yet on how important or integral this character will be but I imagine Leguizamo will chew the scenery up every time he’s on screen.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Leguizamo is just the next member in a stellar cast that includes Fassbender, Pitt, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Dean Norris and Rosie Perez. The film is currently shooting and will be released sometime next year.</p><p data-characters=18 data-current-count=18 data-injectable=false>Source: <a href=#>Just Jared</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomauZlGK9qsDTZpqorZ6osq270WahqKCeYrmms9SisZqln2K3sLXNrGSfoZyifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
