Unfortunately, as time went on, the forest around the mansion was being cut down to make way for buildings. Eventually, all of the Shroomish left the mansion.</p><p>By the events of <i>Taming of the Shroomish</i>, the <a href=# title="Rinshin Town">Rinshin Town</a> council had begun the clearing of the mansion site to make way for new development. However, these plans were marred by strange occurrences, and the workers complaining of feeling sick from the mansion. Alex would occasionally check up on the progress, and during one of his visits he spotted <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> on the property. He ordered them to move off the demolition zone, but Max insisted that he was simply following after a Shroomish. Alex refuted the claims, but decided to investigate the mansion out of curiosity.</p><p>Inside the mansion, they soon located the Shroomish that Max had earlier befriended. A stampede of Shroomish later appeared when <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> first arrived to steal <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>. Alex was surprised that the Shroomish had been living inside the Green Lodge all this time. Having witnessed the Shroomish defend the mansion against Team Rocket a second time, Alex decided that the demolition would still go ahead. But instead of new development, he would restore the property to a forest perfect for the Shroomish to live in.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Befriended>Befriended</span></h3><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=5.9942166140904><tr><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Alex's Shroomish (multiple)"><img alt="Alex's Shroomish (multiple)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/37/Alex_Shroomish.png/300px-Alex_Shroomish.png decoding=async width=200 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b><span id=Shroomish_(multiple)></span>Shroomish (multiple)</b></td></tr><tr readability=22.6875><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=23.6328125>Alex has befriended many <a href=# title="Shroomish (Pokémon)">Shroomish</a>.

Shroomish was suspicious and used Stun Spore; causing Ash and Max to quickly back away in surprise.<p>Ash and Max noted that Shroomish was in the city instead of the forest, where its kind normally would live. Figuring that it might have been separated from its Trainer, they decided that they should take it to a <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a>. Max took out a handkerchief and tied it around the top of Shroomish's head as a gift. The gift made Shroomish very happy and Max picked up Shroomish and they headed off.</p><p>While heading to the Center, Max noticed Shroomish staring intently at an abandoned mansion on their route. Shroomish rushed into the Green Lodge through a broken window. Paths crossed when Ash and Max caught up with <a href=# title="May (anime)">May</a> and <a href=# title="Brock (anime)">Brock</a> who were keen to learn more about the allegedly haunted Green Lodge, while its custodian Alex was inspecting the demolition site. Together they ventured inside the Green Lodge and discovered that entire herd of Shroomish inhabited the property. Alex was particularly surprised as he had assumed that all the Shroomish simply left the area because of <a href=# title="Rinshin Town">Rinshin Town</a>'s growth and his grandfather's passing. The discovery of the Shroomish also explained all of the ghostly occurrences reported by the demolition workers such as <a href=# title=Footprint>footprints</a> and wafting smells, which was revealed to be the Shroomish using Stun Spore.</p><p>The Shroomish went on to defend the Green Lodge against two attacks from <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>.
