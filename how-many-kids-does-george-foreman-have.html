His first wife was Adrienne Calhoun, whom he was married to from 1971 to 1974. After divorcing Calhoun, Foreman remained unmarried until 1977, when he married Cynthia Lewis. When that relationship ended in 1979, Foreman remained single for a few years before marrying Sharon Goodson in 1981.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>However, this union was also short-lived, as Foreman married Andrea Skeete in 1982. In 1985, Foreman married his current wife, Mary Joan Martelly.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>Across these relationships, Foreman has had 10 biological children: five boys and five girls. On top of this, he also adopted two daughters, meaning that Foreman has 12 children altogether.</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>Foreman’s daughters are named the following:</p><ul data-current-count=433.5 data-injectable=true><li>Courtney</li><li>Freeda</li><li>Georgetta</li><li>Isabella</li><li>Leola</li><li>Michi</li><li>Natalia</li></ul><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Despite this lovely assortment of names, it’s Foreman’s sons who get the most attention. This is because Foreman’s sons are all named George, usually with an added nickname. For example, there’s:</p><ul data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true><li>George Jr.</li><li>“Monk” George III</li><li>“Big Wheel” George IV</li><li>“Red” George V</li><li>“Little Joey” George VI</li></ul><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Amusingly, in a 2009 interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a>, Foreman explained that George V was nicknamed “Red” ⏤ a tongue-in-cheek stoplight reference ⏤ because Foreman and his wife had decided not to have any more children. This nickname didn’t go as planned, however, as the couple had one more son after George V.</p><h2 id=h-why-are-all-of-george-foreman-s-sons-called-george data-injectable=false>Why are all of George Foreman’s sons called George?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/george-foreman-sons-GettyImages-164097641.jpg><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>While it’s not uncommon for families to have at least one child who bears his father’s namesake, it is rare for every son in a single clan to share the same name.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>George has explained this decision in his various interviews and books. In fact, on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official website’s</a> “Did You Know” section, George dedicates one part to explaining the names of his sons.&nbsp;</p><p>“I named all my sons George Edward Foreman so they would always have something in common. I say to them, ‘If one of us goes up, then we all go up together. And if one goes down, we all go down together!'”</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Foreman’s decision to name all of his sons directly after him might not be a popular choice for everybody, but when it comes to the former boxer wanting to maintain family history and general closeness, it’s certainly hard to argue with his inspiration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMppinsV2gtqW%2FjJ2mnqtdnLKwvsaeZJ%2Bnopq6orqMoZivnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
