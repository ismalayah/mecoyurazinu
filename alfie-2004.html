He had a brash Cockney self-confidence that suggested a hardness beneath the kidding around. <a href=#>Jude Law</a> is already a movie star, currently one of the busiest, and in "Alfie" he is less a predator than Caine, more a needy hedonist who is wounded and even surprised when women won't put up with him.</p><p>Of course he meets a different kind of woman in 2004 than Caine met in 1966; the feminist revolution, the rise and fall of the one-night stand and the specter of AIDS all happened between those two dates, and today a compulsively promiscuous man is more of a danger to himself and his partners than he was then. In 1966, the worst thing Alfie brings about is an abortion; in the 2004 version, his greatest crime is essentially to throw away the love of the only woman he really cares for.</p><p>That would be Julie (<a href=#>Marisa Tomei</a>), who is honest and grounded and has a young son to care for, and absolutely will not share Alfie with other women. Of course for a time she doesn't know about the other women. Alfie confesses, in one of his rueful speeches directly to the camera, that the tricky thing about dating a woman with a kid is that you get to really like the kid. It's also tricky, as Alfie discovers, when you get to like the woman.</p><p>Alfie is still British in this version, but more upmarket, and now living in Manhattan, where his job as a limo driver gives him access to a lot of women, and they to him. We meet them as he does: Dorie (<a href=#>Jane Krakowski</a>) the lonely married woman; Liz (<a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a>), a successful businesswoman with a no-nonsense approach to obtaining sex, and Nikki (<a href=#>Sienna Miller</a>), a beautiful model who wanders into his life and seems to be the undemanding woman of his dreams. Then there's Lonette (<a href=#>Nia Long</a>), the girlfriend of his best friend Marlon (<a href=#>Omar Epps</a>). She should be forbidden territory, but to Alfie borders are made to be crossed.</p><p>The first film, directed by <a href=#>Lewis Gilbert</a>, closely followed the era of the British Angry Young Men movies, and contained echoes of the proletarian anger of characters played by such actors as <a href=#>Albert Finney</a> and <a href=#>Tom Courtenay</a>. The new film comes out of a lad-mag era, in which Alfie is better dressed, smoother and smoldering not with anger but with a spoiled boy's desire to be indulged. Both 1966 and 2004 are probably getting the characters they deserve; narcissism has evolved in 38 years from a character flaw to a male fashion attribute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ao5%2BhlWJ%2FcXyT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
