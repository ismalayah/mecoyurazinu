The film’s producer Stephen Broussard even claimed that Quantumania “will have a <a href=#>significant impact on the future of the MCU</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>Needless to say, a movie of Quantumania’s size, no pun intended, is going to open the doors to vistas previously unexplored, one being the quantum realm. Yes, the MCU has explored the quantum realm in the past with Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Avengers: Endgame, but it’s only grazed the surface. Because the majority of Quantumania will take place inside the quantum realm, we’re about to get our biggest glimpse behind the curtain yet.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Of the number of new characters joining the Quantumania cast is Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. actress Katy M. O’Brian as <strong>Jentorra</strong>. The character has a rich history with Marvel Comics and just might be someone with an important part to play in Scott Lang’s journey to return home.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-jentorra-and-how-will-she-play-into-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania data-injectable=false>Who is Jentorra and how will she play into Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-3.jpg><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>In Marvel Comics, Jentorra is the green-skinned, magic-wielding sorceress and niece of Princess Jarella of the subatomic planet K’ai. Jentorra was trained by the Triad of Sorcerers and possesses the power to teleport herself and others across great distances, as well as use her magic to heal herself and others.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>Because of Jentorra’s presence in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, it has been assumed that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Micronauts</a> are gearing up for their MCU debut. The Micronauts are a huge part of the history of the Microverse, aka the Quantum Realm. The Micronauts, however, are only a licensed property of Marvel. The comic book rights to the original characters belong with Marvel, but the screen rights remain with Hasbro.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>What that means is it’s unlikely the Micronauts will make their MCU debut in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, at least not by name. As such, Jentorra is listed as the leader of a group of rebels known as the Freedom Fighters on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU’s wiki page</a>. The Freedom Fighters are “inhabitants in the Quantum Realm displaced by Kang the Conqueror.”</p><p data-characters=664 data-current-count=1015 data-injectable=true>When Jentorra encounters Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet – because we’re confident she will – it’s likely she could use her powers of teleportation to help them get to where they need to go, or possibly use her healing powers to remedy Scott’s injuries. As we saw from the trailer, Scott is going to receive a pretty bad beating from Kang, so much so that fans have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all but prepared themselves for his demise</a>. Having a magic-wielding sorceress with healing abilities is just the kind of ace up the sleeve Scott needs if he has any hope of making it out alive.&nbsp;That’s if the MCU version of Jentorra remains the same as her comic book one.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania premieres in theaters on Feb. 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbrbEp6uoqqKWeqq6jJqlrWWdlrturc2dZK2glWLEor%2FPZqiumZ6pwq6tzaKYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
