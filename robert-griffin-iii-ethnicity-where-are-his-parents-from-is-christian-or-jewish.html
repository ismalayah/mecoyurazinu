Is Christian Or Jewish?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-24</div><p><strong>Robert Griffin III,</strong> the former quarterback, is a devout Christian who values his ethnicity. Robert never shies away from discussing religion and faith. During the broadcast of the LSU-Ole Miss football game, the former football player made a shocking statement.&nbsp;Furthermore, he mentioned Jesus being ‘on the cross’ when speaking. Let’s look further into what transpired throughout the game and how it relates to Griffin’s faith.</p><p>Robert Lee Griffin III was an NFL quarterback for eight seasons and now works as an analyst for ESPN College Football and NFL Live.&nbsp;Griffin also hosts the podcast series “RG3 and The Ones,” in which he interviews NFL personnel.&nbsp;The Copperas Cove High School graduate went to the University of Houston to play football.&nbsp;Griffin began his NFL career when the Washington Redskins picked him with the second overall selection in the 2012 NFL Draft.&nbsp;After four seasons with the Redskins, he signed with the Cleveland Browns before joining the Ravens on April 4, 2014.</p><h2>Robert Griffin III’s Religion: Is He Christian or Jewish?</h2><p>There is no dispute about Robert Griffin III’s faith in his religion, Christianity. He is not a Jew.&nbsp;The Christ follower recently made news after sparking controversy with a statement made during the LSU-Ole Miss football game.&nbsp;During the game analysis, Griffin mentioned Jesus and the crucifixion. This prompted criticism and controversy among netizens.</p><p>The remark happened after LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels was sacked by several Ole Miss defenders. Robert recounted the scene, stating, “They lifted that man to the sky like he was Jesus, letting him know they were going to put him on the cross right there.” Griffin is an ardent Christian, so it’s reasonable to believe he didn’t mean anything negative when he mentioned Christ.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Robert-Griffin-III-1.jpg alt="Robert Griffin III" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, RG3 has often discussed his religion and beliefs online. He has officially proclaimed himself a Christian.&nbsp;Furthermore, the former athlete’s Twitter and Instagram bios include references to Jesus.&nbsp;In 2021, on the radio program Faith On The Fields, he defined his connection with God as being able to admit his faults and move on.</p><h2>Robert Griffin III’s Ethnicity And Family History</h2><p><strong>Robert Griffin III</strong> belongs to the African-American ethnicity. RG3 is not hesitant to discuss his ethnicity. He just posted a photo on Instagram with the caption “First All-Black QB Room in NFL History.” Furthermore, he acknowledges and values his heritage wholeheartedly.&nbsp;Robert Griffin Jr. and Jacqueline Ross, his African-American parents, welcomed him into the world on February 12, 1990, in Okinawa, Japan.</p><p>Both of his parents were United States Army sergeants stationed in Japan. Likewise, his grandpa, Robert Griffin I, worked as a foreman for a New Orleans construction business.&nbsp;Having military parents means regularly moving around and adjusting to diverse cultures. Griffin had numerous challenges as a result of his Afro-braided hair and color, but he never gave up.&nbsp;The Griffins relocated to Fort Lewis in Tacoma, Washington, then to New Orleans, Louisiana, before settling in Copperas Cove, Texas.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Robert-Griffin-III-2.jpg alt="Robert Griffin III" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Regarding RG3’s name, his grandfather intended to call him Robert. Robert II had long regretted naming his son Robert III.&nbsp;He didn’t want his kid to bear the responsibility of living up to his father’s name.&nbsp;However, all doubts vanished when RG3 arrived for his first game proudly wearing his Roman number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqJqVp8Fus9GinZ%2BhnmK2qrWMnquhppmYtrXFjLCfnqqVYq6zsYyhoKxloJa%2FprrTrGSfqp%2Bieqq%2FjJyfq6GjqbaiuoyoqWailay2tLSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
