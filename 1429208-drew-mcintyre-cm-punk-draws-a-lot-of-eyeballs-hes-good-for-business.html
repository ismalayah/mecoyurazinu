He draws a lot of eyeballs, that’s very clear. You can just look at the numbers. I’m a bigger-picture person. I tend to use that criminology degree and look at, beyond all reasonable doubt, look at the evidence, and I’m not gonna go into great details right now because now’s not the time.</p><p>“But what I said on RAW is there are so few people on the current roster that have been on the same roster as him for years and years. I signed when I was 22, I was actually 21 when I signed but I was television when I was 22 in 2007. I spent years, I was around the person, I know the person. [So] I know what he’s truly like.”</p><h2 id=h-drew-mcintyre-on-cm-punk-i-ve-got-stories>Drew McIntyre On CM Punk: I’ve Got Stories</h2><p>Drew McIntyre went on to state that he knows Punk’s return does numbers, and that’s awesome for now. He noted that he would wait and see how it played out. McIntyre stated that he has stories, but he would keep them to himself. However, he made it clear that he would drop Punk of they crossed paths.</p><p>I”’m aware it’s cool and does numbers,” Drew McIntyre said. “That’s awesome for right now. But I’m gonna wait and see right now because I can’t control who gets signed, who doesn’t get signed. I’ve got stories. I’m gonna keep them to myself, and in the future, if we cross paths, I ain’t the same guy I was as I was in 2010. I’m a lot bigger, smarter, more experienced, and I’ll drop his arse.”</p><p>McIntyre will challenge Seth Rollins for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the January 1 episode of WWE RAW.</p><p>The full video can be seen here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNrcGtoaGKxs7HWZqScoZ6pxrOxjJykZqilo7husNGarqxlkWK5sMCMqJ1mnamar6K4y6xkoZ2jYrSwu8NmnaiqXZfCtLXNnqqs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
