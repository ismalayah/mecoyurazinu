However, it seems like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Pratt</a> (Mario), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Day</a> (Luigi), and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keegan-Michael Key</a> (Toad) decided to prank the comedian, telling him that everyone was going to cosplay as their characters, only for Black to be the only one in costume. So to make Black feel better, Black received a “special VIP entrance” on the show, where he revealed his Bowser body in all its glory… literally.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>Little did the actor know that the show was going to censor bits of his costume, most specifically, the crotch area. Interestingly enough, the cameraman noticed something off with Black’s costume and immediately moved to a mid shot during his and Clarkson’s one-on-one backstage. Sadly, the costume was blurred during his entrance. But that doesn’t matter since he made the costume his own anyway, wowing both the audience and the rest of the cast. Fortunately, it was only that area that was deemed unacceptable to the broadcaster.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>This isn’t the first time Black has unleashed his inner Bowser to the audience. During the 2022 New York Comic-Con, Black sat on a throne after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first trailer was released</a>, and did a Q&A with an audience and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showcased his voice-acting talents to the audience</a>. During the trailer’s premiere, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans went nuts during Black’s Super Mario debut</a> especially when compared to Pratt’s appearance.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>If you want to see more of Black portraying the King of the Koopas, The Super Mario Bros Movie is scheduled to hit theaters on April 5, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3oq%2FKZpmlmZOgwG6uzrCqnqpdmLy0wNSmnGavkah6tbvOZqWsnqdis7C%2BjK2YpaNdqLWww4ytrWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
