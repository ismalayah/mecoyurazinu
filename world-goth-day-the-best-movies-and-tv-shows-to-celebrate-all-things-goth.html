May 22 is now recognized as <strong>World Goth Day</strong> after two BBC DJs — appropriately named Martin OldGoth and Cruel Britannia — started the tradition in 2009. Like many popular subcultures, Goth was born out of music; the first mention of “Gothic Rock” was when music critic John Stickney used the term to describe the music made by The Doors and soon, other bands would embrace the label. In the 1980s and ’90s, Goth music was at its peak with bands like Joy Division, the Cure, and Bauhaus coming into prominence. Like many great subcultures, Goth fans had a look; those who were part of the scene were easily identifiable with their black clothing, Victorian-era influence, lace, and fishnets.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Goth remains a loved subculture in the present day — the act of labeling different aesthetics is arguably similar to the coining of subcultures like Grunge and riotgrrrl in the ’90s, and there’s nothing the youth of today loves more than celebrating these subcultures. Whether you grew up as an initial adopter of the Goth scene or you just want to learn more, World Goth Day is a perfect excuse to don your darkest clothes, listen to some Joy Division, and watch these 7 movies and TV shows that represent the Goth vibe.</p><h2 id=h-7-nana-2006-2007 data-injectable=false>7. Nana (2006-2007)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=724 data-current-count=1024 data-injectable=true>Based on the popular manga, the anime Nana tells the story of two girls with the same name who, although very different, become friends after a chance encounter. While not necessarily a gothic story, character Nana Oosaki dresses in a very Goth style while following her dream of becoming a famous musician in a rock band. Style is almost a third main character in the anime and thanks to a recent resurgence of Vivienne Westwood (the orb logo is all over the characters and coincidentally, my dream closet), Nana‘s fashion is even more popular today then it was when the anime was released. The looks are an appealing part of the anime, but the realistic storyline and well-written characters are just as compelling.</p><h2 id=h-8-wednesday-the-addams-family-2022-1991 data-injectable=false>8. Wednesday/The Addams Family (2022 & 1991)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=606 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>OK, I realize this is technically two entries, but it felt wrong to recommend The Addams Family without acknowledging the runaway success of the recently-released Wednesday. The Addams Family are quintessentially Goth, especially Morticia Adams (my personal favorite is Anjelica Hudson’s portrayal) and their appreciation for all things macabre spans several decades. Whatever your thoughts about the new Wednesday, you can’t deny the show is introducing the family to a new generation of viewers, and Jenna Ortega doing the dance in that gorgeous black dress is a TV moment we’ll remember for years.</p><h2 id=h-6-the-hunger-1983 data-injectable=false>6. The Hunger (1983)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=681 data-current-count=981 data-injectable=true>This movie is Goth cinema at its finest, complete with vampires, gore, and the “cruel elegance of David Bowie.” Bowie stars as John, a vampire who was promised eternal life by his lover Miriam (Catherine Denevue) but, when he starts to age at a rapid pace, he begins to question that promise. John then seeks the assistance of human gerontologist Sarah (Susan Sarandon) to see whether the aging process can be reversed or slowed. As you can probably infer, things do not go as planned, and things become even more complicated when Miriam takes a liking to Sarah. While The Hunger got mixed reviews at release, it’s become a classic among fans of all things Goth.</p><h2 id=h-5-black-butler-2008-2010 data-injectable=false>5. Black Butler (2008-2010)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=818 data-current-count=1118 data-injectable=true>The popular anime Black Butler is more Goth in a traditional sense (think Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or Bram Stoker’s Dracula) and tells the story of Ciel, a young boy who is kidnapped and sold into slavery by the group that killed his parents. He then finds himself in the custody of a brutal, demon-worshiping cult who eventually succeed in summoning a demon; things backfire for the cult when the demon only agrees to enter a contract with Ciel, who technically summoned him. Ciel then enters a contract with the demon (who he names Sebastian, after his deceased dog) in order to get revenge on the people that murdered his family but at the eventual cost of his soul. While the show differs from the manga in the second season, the first season is generally regarded as some of the best anime around.</p><h2 id=h-4-underworld-2003 data-injectable=false>4. Underworld (2003)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=726 data-current-count=1026 data-injectable=true>Underworld tells a story of a gritty world where vampires and lycans (short for lycanthrope, or werewolves) have been at war for centuries and Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a vampire Death Dealer who is sworn to lead the fight against Lycans. Things get complicated for Selene when she learns the Lycans are targeting a seemingly ordinary human named Michael, who she finds herself attracted to. When Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene finds herself between love and her duty to her vampire clan. Though the movie got mixed reviews at release, it spanned several sequels and has built a cult following. If you love Matrix-inspired Goth fashion (so much leather) and forbidden love stories, you’ll enjoy Underworld.</p><h2 id=h-3-the-crow-1994 data-injectable=false>3. The Crow (1994)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>During the height of the Goth subculture, The Crow premiered in 1994 and is based on the comic by James O’Barr. One Halloween, rock star Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancée, Shelley Webster, were murdered the night before their wedding. A year later, a mysterious crow resurrects Eric, who sets on a quest to avenge his and Shelley’s deaths. Draven’s fashion and the off-kilter revenge plot helped make this film both a commercial hit and a Goth classic. Tragically, Brandon Lee was killed in an accident on set and the film was released in dedication of Lee and his fiancée.</p><h2 id=h-2-beetlejuice-1988 data-injectable=false>2. Beetlejuice (1988)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=658 data-current-count=958 data-injectable=true>Honestly, any of Tim Burton’s films are candidates for this list, and Beetlejuice is one of his best. The film follows a newly- deceased couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are annoyed when their house is sold to a new, living family. The couple become even more frustrated when their clumsy attempts to scare away the new residents fail, and they turn to the help of freelance exorcist of the living — namely, Beetlejuice, who proves to be more than they bargained for. The movie is a classic and inspired generations of baby goths to model themselves after Wynona Rider’s effortless goth style — thank you for the baby bangs, Winona.</p><h2 id=h-1-the-craft-1996 data-injectable=false>1. The Craft (1996)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=899 data-injectable=false>The Craft successfully combines the supernatural with the mundane of everyday high school life, and it does it with style (I would happily browse the costume department of this film any day). The film follows four average teenagers who are outcasts at their Catholic high school and rumored to be witches. When they successfully begin to use witchcraft for their own gain, the girls’ quest for more power leads to disastrous results. With a killer soundtrack and a strong commitment to the aesthetic, The Craft is mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to know more about the Goth subculture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqiqnJl6qLvToWSdmaliwamxjJucrKxdory3tcSsZJqmlGLBt3nSoaawq12pvG6vxKWcm6qRqbJurculZK2gmaO0tHnGqKuhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
