Recommended Videos When you sit down to watch The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, it is natural to expect the special presentation to address the long-standing question of the alternate Gamora’s absence. Although the film sorely disappoints on that front, it tries to make up for it by introducing a rather unexpected twist — though the studio had voluntarily spoiled it in advance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is due to the fact that the mighty Celestial had a hobby of siring children everywhere he went.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>The special presentation put an end to the theories by confirming that, yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mantis and Peter are indeed siblings</a>. Peter doesn’t really have any fond memories of his father, who killed his mother and tried to end his life as well in his bid to remake the universe.

This has been something that has been suspected since Vol. 2 came out thanks to an Easter egg and a since-altered Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Apparently, Ego mated with a female from the species Mantis belongs to. This was something that was noticed by fans in the many displays the Celestial presents while revealing how he tried to create another being like him. This was enough for fans to speculate whether Mantis and Peter share a familial bond.</p><h2 id=h-the-theory-was-not-initially-confirmed data-injectable=false>The theory was not initially confirmed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true><a href=#>LOOK AT THE CAPTION</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Yashselokar</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Though James Gunn shot down the theory at the time, the speculation was backed by a post by actress, Jennifer Sharp, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded</a> a picture of herself in Mantis-like makeup and confirmed that she had been a part of a deleted scene in the film. But the original content of the caption she framed — and swiftly changed — revealed that she was indeed supposed to play Mantis’ mother and one of Ego’s many partners.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Evidently, the MCU and Gunn are done shooting down the very obvious assessment of fans and have finally confirmed that Mantis is indeed Peter’s half-sister. The only thing left to wonder about is why Ego, who killed every single one of his children because they didn’t have Celestial powers, didn’t subject Mantis to the same fate. The most reasonable explanation is that it was probably because she was of use to Ego. She aided in lessening the pull of his neurotic tendencies with her empathic powers, which may have been enough to spare her life.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>As Peter has warmly accepted Mantis as his sister, we can say that all’s well that ends well.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is currently streaming on Disney Plus.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmnpqllWKwqa3NoKCnn12owaK%2BjKWmq5xdlrulecyapa2ho2LBuLXSrWSipl2ptaZ5xq6Yq5yZlru0ec6fZK2glWK0orjAsbBmoJ%2BhtqWt2GaqqZ2Tnq6tecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
