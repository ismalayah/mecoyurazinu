Speaking of, unfortunately Ironheart <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t due to hit streaming for another 2 years</a>, but at least we just got our first official confirmation that Sacha Baron Cohen is definitely involved in the cast. He’s listed in the registration as playing a character credited as Mystery Man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mephisto.jpg><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>If you cast your mind <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back to a year ago</a>, when Cohen — who has three Oscar nominations to his name thanks to both Borat movies — was first reported to have joined the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever spinoff, it was claimed that he could be portraying Mephisto. Yes, the duplicitous demon himself who fans have been theorizing would enter the fray ever since WandaVision. With Marvel so keen to keep his role’s identity under wraps, but also going with an alias beginning with M, the chances of Cohen really being our Mephisto just shot up.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>So why should we be excited about this? Well, Kang’s great and all, but as pretty much the Devil of the Marvel universe, Mephisto’s reality-warping abilities make him a force to be reckoned with — just see the One More Day comics arc in which he rewrote continuity to reboot Spider-Man’s entire life. With some kind of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">soft relaunch of the MCU expected to happen</a> in Avengers: Secret Wars, he may even go toe-to-toe with Kang come the Multiverse Saga’s conclusion.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Again, though, don’t get to hyped just yet as Cohen’s Mephisto (if that is indeed who he is) won’t turn up until Ironheart gets here in September 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yieZJmq6KllWK8tK%2FAq2Snp52eu6axjKmjmrGZo7RuwMeeZGplnaq5tbXVnqmsnV2orqitjK%2BgpaSRnrtuuc6rnGaon6yys7LUpWStoJGjequ7zZqroZmeYrqits6rqmajkaO0brjOqKKsZZ2kv6Z5y6KinqSpYsGprc1mnK%2BdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
